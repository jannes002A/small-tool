# Tool to convert list into Latex Bucketlist or Simple notes files
This tool can turn simple txt list into Latex Bucketlist, which are nice to print out or
turn them into a format such that they can be loaded into the Simple Notes app (get it on F-Droid).

To use it:
	Create a txt file like in the data folder
```
example.txt
Thing 1
Thing 2
Thing 3
```

Then go to the src folder and do 
```
python3 make_list.py -n example -l 1
```
to create a pdf with bulletpoints. You can find the resulte in the res folder. In the res folder you can also find a txt file which you can send to your phone and load it into Simple Note. You can load the txt into the app and have a nice list. 

Enjoy!
